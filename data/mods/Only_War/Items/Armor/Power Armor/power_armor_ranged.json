    "description": "The Cyclone Missile Launcher is a specially designed Missile Launcher system used by Space Marines in Terminator Armour to provide heavy fire support. Since Terminator Squads are an elite force, they are often called upon to undertake the toughest and most dangerous missions in the most hazardous conditions or to serve on the most dangerous battlefields. Therefore, Terminator Squads need a range of fire support weapons in order for them to successfully achieve their objectives in any tactical situation. To provide the additional firepower without affecting mobility or compromising accuracy, various weapons have been created by the Tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus.",
